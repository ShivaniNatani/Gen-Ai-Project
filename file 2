To build your output file using both the dataset folder (containing DICOM images) and the model folder (containing your `.py` and `.pt` files) with Bazel, you can follow these detailed steps. You’ll utilize your existing `load_model.py` file without making any changes.

### Step 1: Directory Structure

Ensure that your directory structure is correctly set up like this:

```
/path/to/build/
├── dataset/
│   └── train/              # Contains DICOM images (e.g., image1.dcm, image2.dcm)
└── model/
    ├── load_model.py       # Your existing Python script
    └── model.pt            # PyTorch model file
```

### Step 2: Create a WORKSPACE File

If you haven’t already created a `WORKSPACE` file, do so:

```bash
cd /path/to/build
touch WORKSPACE
```

### Step 3: Create a BUILD File

Create a `BUILD` file in your `/path/to/build` directory:

```bash
touch BUILD
```

**Edit the `BUILD` file** with the following content:

```python
load("@rules_python//python:defs.bzl", "py_binary")

py_binary(
    name = "dicom_processor",          # Name of the Bazel target
    srcs = ["model/load_model.py"],    # Path to your existing Python script
    data = [
        "dataset/train",                # Directory with DICOM images (train data)
        "model/model.pt",               # Path to your model file
    ],
    deps = [
        "@pip//pydicom",                # Dependency for pydicom
        "@pip//torch",                  # Dependency for torch
    ],
    main = "model/load_model.py",      # Main entry point for Bazel
)
```

### Step 4: Install Required Dependencies

Make sure you have the necessary Python packages installed in your environment:

```bash
pip install pydicom torch
```

### Step 5: Install Bazel (If Not Already Installed)

If Bazel isn't installed, follow the installation steps:

```bash
# Install Bazelisk, which helps manage Bazel versions
curl -L https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/releases/download/v1.17.0/bazelisk-linux-amd64 -o bazelisk
chmod +x bazelisk
sudo mv bazelisk /usr/local/bin/bazel
```

### Step 6: Build and Run with Bazel

Now you can build and run your target:

1. **Navigate to your build directory**:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/build
   ```

2. **Build the target**:
   ```bash
   bazel build //:dicom_processor
   ```

3. **Run the target**:
   ```bash
   bazel-bin/dicom_processor
   ```

### Step 7: Check the Output

After running the command, check for the `output.txt` file in the current directory:

```bash
cat output.txt
```

### Important Notes

- **Using the Existing Script**: Since you're using your existing `load_model.py`, ensure that this script processes all the DICOM images from the `dataset/train` directory and saves the results to `output.txt` as expected.
  
- **Correct Paths**: Make sure the paths in the `BUILD` file reflect your actual directory structure. The Bazel command will pick up the files based on the `data` section you defined.

- **Output Verification**: The script should be designed to handle the input data properly and generate `output.txt` without errors.

This setup will allow you to use both folders to build your output file. If you need any further clarification or run into issues, let me know!
